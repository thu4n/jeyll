A basic Winforms (C#, .NET) desktop application built for tracking delivery packages. The goal for this project was for me to learn HTTP handling processes during the Network Application course at my uni. It was developed with its own server and database hosted on Azure, but of course, all of which were removed because keeping them running would cost a lot of money.
