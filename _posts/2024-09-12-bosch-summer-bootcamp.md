Alright, greeting to anyone reading this, it's been a really long time since I last wrote a blog post in English. So, like the title stated, I spent the last summer joining the internship program at Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam (BGSV) and it was a lot of fun! Thereby, I feel that sharing the story here would be nice for me to look back in maybe a few years.

## The Internship Hunt


It was around April of 2024 that I started writing my first ever resume because I wanted to do it in summer. The intern position that I'm initially after is **DevOps**, part of the reason is that I unironically love all the cloud buzzwords and CI/CD thingy. The first and second verion of my resume were *terrible*... since I didn't really know how to write these things. Still, cluelessly decided that it was good enough for submission, I began to look for internship recruitments on the Internet (mainly LinkedIn and Indeed). Unsurprisingly, it was tough at that time with *very few* companies actually hiring DevOps intern. The first one I apply for was the Silver Peacock Solutions company (not their actual name) and of couse, I got dropped at the CV scanning round. They seemed weird anyways as all they hired all years around are interns and not official positions (What's up with that??).

I thought about rewriting my resume at this point and I'm glad I did. I realized that my resume wasn't ticking all the keywords in the job listing. Also, an important factor is timing, applying as early as possible can make the chance of your resume actually getting looked at way higher. Combining the keyword-matching CV and the timing factor, I managed to get an interview and then an offer for DevOps intern. However, the salary for this one is quite low (even for intern standard) so I hold off the offer and continued searching.

Just a few days after, I received an email from the company in this blog's title. They were announcing their short-term internship program called "Bosch Summber Bootcamp 2024". In the list of available positions, what caught my attention was "**Infrastructure Engineer Intern**". The job description said something similar to this: "Bla bla bla Docker container, bla bla bla cloud technologies". Okay, sounds good to me. I immediately rewrote my resume to fit with the JD and then submitted it. About 2 days later, I got the call for interview.

## The Interview

The first round of the interview process is just HR testing my English speaking skill and making sure that I knew what I were applying for. Nothing special to be told here, I passed this rather easily.

Second and final round, the technical interview. I travelled 23km to get to their office and met Mr. TechLead who would be the interviewer. He was pretty chill the whole time and I was the opposite - extremely nervous. All the questions were about what I wrote on my CV. He asked me how I would differentiate Java, Go and C#; a couple questions about Linux commands and OOP pinciples were also asked. He requested me to draw the architecture diagram of one of my projects which used Azure Kubernetes Service and OpenFaaS. Those are the questions that I could remember; I didn't manage to answer all of them perfectly but I did nail the diagram drawing and explaining part. At the end of the interview, he talked a bit more about what his team were working on and why he needed to hire an intern for the Infrastructure Engineer role.

Roughly a week later, I received another call from HR. The call was to announce that I got the offer (Hell yeah). So begin the first internship of my career.
