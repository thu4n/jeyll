Alright, greeting to anyone reading this, it's been a really long time since I last wrote a blog post in English. So, like the title stated, I spent the last summer joining the internship program at Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam (BGSV) and it was a lot of fun! Thereby, I feel that sharing the story here would be nice for me to look back in maybe a few years.

## The Internship Hunt


It was around April of 2024 that I started writing my resume because I wanted to do it in summer. The intern position that I'm initially after is **DevOps**, part of the reason is that I unironically love all the cloud buzzwords and CI/CD thingy. The first or second verion of my resume was *terrible*... since I didn't really know how to write these things. Still, cluelessly decided that it was good enough for submissions, I began to look for internship recruitments on the Internet (mainly LinkedIn and Indeed). Unsurprisingly, it was tough at that time with *very few* companies actually hiring DevOps intern. The first one I apply for was the Silver Peacock Solutions company (not their actual name) and of couse, I got dropped at the CV scanning round.

I thought about rewriting my resume at this point and I'm glad I did. I realized that my resume wasn't ticking all the keywords in the job listing. Also, an important factor is timing, applying as early as possible can make the chance of your resume actually getting looked at way higher. Combining the keyword-matching CV and the timing factor, I managed to get an interview and then an offer for DevOps intern. However, the salary for this one is quite low (even for intern standard) so I hold off the offer and continued searching.

Just a few days after, I received an email from the company in this blog's title. They were announcing their short-term internship program called "Bosch Summber Bootcamp 2024". In the list of available positions, what caught my attention was "Infrastructure Engineer Intern". The job description said something similar to this: "Bla bla bla Docker container, bla bla bla cloud technologies". Okay, sounds good to me. I immeadiately.
