A community project where we stored all learning materials that we gathered during our university courses and shared them via a public website. The website is hosted on GitHub pages and uses the Jekyll theme of JustTheDocs with a bit of customization of our own. My involvement in the project is maintaining the overall operation the site and providing my own study materials.
