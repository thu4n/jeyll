A scientific research oriented project in which I deployed a wireless embedded network system for human activities recognitions through CSI signal data in WiFi captured by the ESP32 microcontrollers and processed by the Jetson Nano Developer Kit platform. The system also involved an MQTT broker and an Android application to integrate interaction with end users.
